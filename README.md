## Abstract
Tomographic Volumetric Additive Manufacturing (TVAM) is an emerging 3D printing technology that can create complex objects in under a minute. The key idea is to project intense light patterns onto a rotating vial of photo-sensitive resin, causing polymerization where the cumulative dose of these patterns reaches the polymerization threshold. We formulate the pattern calculation as an inverse light transport problem and solve it via physically based differentiable rendering. In doing so, we address long-standing limitations of prior work by accurately modeling and correcting for scattering in composite resins, printing in non-symmetric vials, and supporting unusual printing geometries. We also introduce an improved discretization scheme that exploits the ray tracing operation to mitigate resolution-related artifacts in prints. We demonstrate the benefits of our method in real-world experiments, where our computed patterns produce prints with an improved fidelity.



## About this project

Dr.TVAM is a high-performance inverse rendering framework for tomographic volumetric additive
manufacturing. It is based on the [Mitsuba renderer](https://www.mitsuba-renderer.org/), and uses physically-based
differentiable rendering to optimize patterns for TVAM. In particular, it supports:

- Printing in scattering media
- Arbitrary vial shapes (round, square, ...)
- Arbitrary projector motions (orthogonal, tilted)
- An improved discretization scheme for the target shape to reduce computational load and to minimize discretization artifacts

## ⚠️ Sign up for online workshop in Spring 2025
* The date is not announced yet, but sign up for the announcement: [here](https://forms.office.com/e/3E0SeYUR1X?origin=lprLink)

## Installation

Installing Dr.TVAM can be done via `pip`:

```bash=
pip install drtvam
```

## Basic Usage

We provide a convenience command-line tool `drtvam` to run simple optimizations. You can run it as:

```bash=
drtvam path/to/config.json
```
Please refer to the documentation for details on the configuration file format. 
Dr.TVAM will run multi-threaded on your machine but will also use your CUDA GPU and your [RT cores](https://developer.nvidia.com/rtx/ray-tracing) if supported by your hardware. 

## Advanced Usage

Dr.TVAM provides a set of useful abstractions to implement a wide variety of
custom TVAM setups. We show examples in the documentation to get you started.

## Documentation

The full documentation for this project, along with jupyter notebooks
explaining the basics of implementing your own optimizations in our framework,
can be found on [readthedocs](https://drtvam.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
